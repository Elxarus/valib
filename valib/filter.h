  \class Filter
  \brief Base interface for all filters

  Filter is a basic building block of audio processing. Filters do most of
  jobs: decoding, encoding, processing, format conversions, etc.

  Audio data is processed in blocks called chunks (see Chunk class). Each input
  chunk may be processed in several steps, producing several output chunks. Or,
  several input chunks may produce one output.

  Filter may convert one data format into another. So, it has input and output
  formats. Also, output format may change during processing.

  \section filter_classification Filter classification

  Threre'are many types of filters. But most have similar behavior.
  Classification helps in describing these similarities and dirfferences and
  introduces clear terminology.

  \subsection filter_by_formet By format

  Filters accept different input formats. But all formats are divided in 2
  large groups: linear and rawdata. Linear format is an internal representation
  that is convenient for fast processing. Rawdata formats are all other formats
  (including PCM). The general processing scenario is follow:
  - (optional) parse containter format / other rawdata transform
  - input data converted from rawdata format into linear
  - processing is done
  - output data converted from linear format into rawdata format

  Therefore, all filters may be classified by the format:

  - Linear filters. Most of audio processing filters. Accept linear format
    at input and produce linear output.
  - Rawdata filters. Operate on rawdata formats. Do data transformation,
    format detection, etc. 
  - Mixed. All other filters. Some filters do not care about the input format
    at all. For example, Passthrough or Counter filters.

  Decoders may be classified as rawdata filters because of many common
  properties.

  \subsection filter_by_buffering By buffering model

  Filters may process data inplace, at the internal buffer or accumulate
  and process it in large blocks. This leads us directly to the following:

  - Inplace filters. These filters process data inplace at the buffer provided
    at input. Almost always one output chunk is produced for one input chunk
    and flushing is not required. Note, that inplace filter \b may contain
    internal buffer (see BassRedir, CacheFilter, Delay filters). Output data is
    available immediately, i.e. inplace filters do not introduce processing
    lag. Output chunk contains pointer to the input chunk's buffer. The last
    is very important feature, that must be always taken into account.
  - Immediate filters. These filters processe data at internal buffer.
    Because internal buffer is fixed in size in most cases, these filters may
    produce more than one output chunk for one input. Flushing is not required
    generally. Like inplace filters, immediate filters do not introduce
    processing lag and output data is available immediately. Output chunk
    contains poinrters to the internal buffer. Note, that the internal buffer
    returned may be changed by the following inplace filter!
  - Buffering filters. These filters require to accumulate some data to
    process. Because input data is not required to persist in between of
    Filter::process() calls, filter has to copy it into the internal buffer.
    When filter has enougth data it produces one or more output chunks.
    Flushing is generally \b required. Buffering filters introduce processing
    lag and must handle timestamps carefully. Output chunk contains poinrters
    to the internal buffer. Note, that the internal buffer returned may be
    changed by the following inplace filter!

  Note, that some filters may behave differently depending on the input format
  and/or its settings (see Mixer).

  \subsection filter_by_streaming By streaming type

  Filters may break the output stream and start a new one. We may classify
  this behaviour:
  - Single stream filter. Output format is known immediately after open and
    does not change at all. In the simplest case output format equals to the
    input format. Filter settings may affect the output format but such
    change cannot be done on-the-fly, during the audio processing, and may
    require reset() or open() call.
  - Multiple streams. Output format is known immediately after open, but
    filter may finish the output stream and start a new one. This may be a
    result of settings change or because of some internal reasons.
  - Data-driven output format. In this case, filter cannot determine the
    output format immediately after open. It has to receive some data to
    deduct it.

  In first 2 cases output stream is started indirectly immediately after open.
  new_stream() is signaled \b only at the start of a next output stream.

  In contrast, data-driven filter must always start a stream directly with
  new_stream() signal.

  \section timing Handling time stamps

  Time stamps are passed with chunk data and filter is responsible for correct
  transformation of input time stamps into output time stamps.

  Synchronization point (syncpoint) is a point where time stamp may be applied.
  Most compressed audio formats have large indivisible blocks of data (frames),
  and specifiying time for the middle of the frame has no sense.
  
  Each sample of linear format is a syncpoint.

  Timestamp passed with the chunk is applied to the first syncpoint appears at
  the chunk's payload. If the chunk has a timestamp, but does not contain a
  syncpoint or empty, this timestamp is applied to the first syncpoint at
  subsequent data.

  Some general rules filter should follow:
  - No timestamp should be lost
  - Do not create new timestamps
  - Do not move timestamps when possible
  - Move timestamps \b forward when required

  As a rule, timestamp handling for inplace and immediate filters is very
  simple: for each input chunk first output chunk is stamped with input
  timestamp and subsequent chunks (if any) are not stamped.

  Buffering filter is much harder case. In general case buffer's bounds do not
  match input chunks' bounds and therefore we have to move timestamps:

  \verbatim
  t1     t2     t3     t4     t5     t6
  |------|------|------|------|------|------> input chunks
  |--------|--------|--------|--------|-----> output chunks
  t1       t2'      t3'      t4'      t6'
  \endverbatim

  There're two main models of timestamp movement possible depending on the data
  type.

  \subsection timing_normal Normal sync

  This model is applicable for linear format, PCM formats and some other.
  We have to be able to determine time difference based on the data size.

  Incoming timestamp is moved to the start of the next output chunk and
  correction is applied:

  \verbatim
  0      pos2           pos3     pos4       pos5  position in bytes/samples
  t1     t2             t3       t4         t5    timestamp
  |------|--------------|--------|----------|---> input chunks
  |----------|--------|-------------|-------|---> output chunks
  t1         t2+dt2   no time       t4+dt3  t5    timestamp
  0          pos2'    pos3'         pos4'   pos5' position in bytes/samples
  \endverbatim

  For linear format dt can be found as (position in samples):
  dt_n = pos_n' - pos_n / sample_rate

  For PCM format dt is found as (position in bytes):
  dt_n = pos_n' - pos_n / (sample_rate * pcm_word_size * number_of_channels)

  Note, that is is no timestamp at pos3'. Also, t3 is dropped because t4
  is more suitable for the next output timestamp.

  \subsection timing_frame Frame sync

  Frame synchronization model is applicable for 'framed' audio data (MP3, AC3,
  DTS, etc).
  
  Incoming timestamp is moved to the first subsequent syncpoint found without
  any change:

  \verbatim
  t1     t2             t3       t4         t5    timestamp
  |------|--------------|--------|----------|---> input chunks
  |----------|--------|-------------|-------|---> output chunks
  t1         t2       no time       t4      t5    timestamp
  \endverbatim

  \section filter_usage Filter usage patterns

  \subsection no_format_change No format changes

  When input format does not change during the data flow and filter does not
  change its output format we can use the following filter usage pattern.

  \code
  Filter *filter;
  Chunk in, out;
  ...

  // Here we should set filter's parameters, including parameters that may
  // affect the output format. For example, set the channel configuration
  // for Mixer filter, or sample format for Converter filter.

  if (!filter->open(input_format))
  {
    // Cannot open the filter.
    // Do something and exit because we cannot continue the processing.
  }

  // Now filter->get_output() indicates filter's output format, so we can
  // use it to decide what to do with the filtered output and do some
  // preparations.

  try
  {
    // Data processing cycle.
    // May throw Filter::Error exception.

    while (has_more_data())
    {
      in = get_more_data();
      while (filter->process(in, out);)
        do_something(out);
    }

    // Flush the filter.
    // Also may throw Filter::Error exception

    while (filter->flush(out))
      do_something(out);
  }
  catch (Filter::Error)
  {
    // Handle filtering errors
  }

  filter->close();

  \endcode

  \subsection input_stream_chagne Input stream change

  When we expect the change of the input format during the streaming, we must
  call Filter::open() each time the format changes.

  To avoid gaps in the stream because of the buffering Filter::flush() must
  be used before opening the filter with the new format.

  This pattern should also be used when stream changes to another stream with
  the \b same format. For example the change of the movie language by switching
  tracks should be handled in this way. So it is more correctly to tell about
  \b stream change, not a \b format change.

  Note, that in this example we do not expect that filter itself changes its
  output format, so we don't use Filter::new_stream().

  Also note, that we call Filter::open() without closing the filter before.
  It is because Filter::open() may reuse the resources allocated. In other
  words, the use of Filter::close() is optional. Once open filter may reuse
  the resources during the whole lifetime and free it only at the destructor.

  \code
  Filter *filter;
  Chunk in, out;
  ...

  // Here we should set filter's parameters.

  while (has_more_data())
  {
    if (!filter->open(input_format))
    {
      // Cannot open the filter
      // Do something to fix this or break the processing
    }

    // Now filter->get_output() indicates filter's output format, so we can
    // use it to decide what to do with the filtered output and do some
    // preparations.

    try
    {
      while (has_more_data() && !new_stream_begins())
      {
        in = get_more_data();
        while (filter->process(in, out))
          do_something(out);
      }

      // End of the stream because of:
      // * No more data, flush the filter at the end of the stream.
      // * New stream begins, flush the filter to finish the current stream.

      while (filter->flush(out))
        do_something(out);
    }
    catch (Filter::Error)
    {
      // Handle filtering errors
    }
  }

  filter->close();

  \endcode

  \subsection output_stream_chagne Output stream change

  Sometimes filter may change its output format during the processing. This may
  happen because of number of reasons: client of the filter may change its
  parameters, input data may indicate the change of its format, user chooses
  another language, etc.

  As before, it is more correctly to say about \b stream change, not a \b format
  change because the new stream may have the same format.

  Filter indicates such condition with Filter::new_stream() flag. This flag may
  change after successful Filter::process() or Filter::flush() call. When flag
  is set, filter starts a new stream, output chunk made belongs to the new
  stream and Filter::get_output() indicates the new format.

  Note that previous stream must be finished correctly, i.e. downstream filters
  must be flushed before processing of the new stream.

  \code
  Filter *filter;
  Chunk in, out;
  ...

  // Here we should set filter's parameters.

  if (!filter->open(input_format))
  {
    // Cannot open the filter.
    // Do something and exit because we cannot continue the processing.
  }

  // Now filter->get_output() indicates filter's output format, so we can
  // use it to decide what to do with the filtered output and do some
  // preparations.

  try
  {
    // Data processing cycle

    while (has_more_data())
    {
      in = get_more_data();

      // We may change filter parameters,
      // that may affect filter's output format.

      while (filter->process(in, out))
      {
        if (filter->new_stream())
        {
          // Flush downstream
          // Setup using the new output format Filter::get_output()
        }
        do_something(out);
      }
    }

    // Flusing cycle

    while (filter->flush(out))
    {
      if (filter->new_stream())
      {
        // Flush downstream
        // Setup using the new output format Filter::get_output()
      }
      do_something(out);
    }
  }
  catch (Filter::Error)
  {
    // Handle filtering errors
  }

  filter->close();

  \endcode

  \subsection ddof Data-driven output format

  In some cases the format of the output is encoded at the input data. For
  example, SPDIF decoder knows that input format is IEC 61937 but does not know
  at advance what the format of the contained stream is. To know this it must
  receive and decode at least one frame.

  In such case filter does not set the output format after Filter::open() call
  immediately, but only after it receives enough data with (a number of)
  Filter::process() call(s).

  In such case Filter::get_output() returns FORMAT_UNKNOWN after Filter::open().
  Also, filter must start an output stream explicitly by setting
  Filter::new_stream() flag when it determines the output format. (Regular
  filters start the output stream after Filter::open() call indirectly, just by
  indicating the output format).

  Note, that Filter::reset() also must change the output format to
  FORMAT_UNKNOWN because it prepares the filter to receive a new stream and we
  don't know the output format for this stream.

  The pattern differs from the regual output format change pattern only in that
  it checks the format after open() call and does not do the downstream setup
  in case of data-driven output format.

  \code
  Filter *filter;
  Chunk in, out;
  ...

  // Here we should set filter's parameters

  if (!filter->open(input_format))
  {
    // Cannot open the filter.
    // Do something and exit because we cannot continue the processing.
  }

  if (filter->get_output().is_unknown())
  {
    // Data-driven output format mode.
    // We cannot determine the output format of the filter and cannot do any
    // setup.
  }
  else
  {
    // Regular filtering.
    // Now filter->get_output() indicates filter's output format, so we can
    // use it to decide what to do with the filtered output and do some
    // preparations.
  }

  try
  {
    // Data processing cycle

    while (has_more_data())
    {
      in = get_more_data();
      while (filter->process(in, out);)
      {
        if (filter->new_stream())
        {
          // Flush downstream
          // Setup using the new output format Filter::get_output()
        }
        do_something(out);
      }
    }

    // Flusing cycle

    while (filter->flush(out);)
    {
      if (filter->new_stream())
      {
        // Flush downstream
        // Setup using the new output format Filter::get_output()
      }
      do_something(out);
    }
  }
  catch (Filter::Error)
  {
    // Handle filtering errors
  }

  filter->close();

  \endcode

  \name Open & close the filter

  \fn bool Filter::can_open(Speakers spk) const
    \param spk Format to test
    \return Returns true when format is supported and false otherwise.

    Check format support. Returns true when the filter supports the format
    given. Note that filter may fail to open even when the format is supported
    because of resource allocation errors.

    An ability to open the filter with a certain format also depends on filter
    parameters. When parameters change can_open() result may also change.

    This function should not throw because of resource allocation errors or
    other reasons. I.e. it should catch all exceptions during the test and
    return false in such case.

  \fn bool Filter::open(Speakers spk)
    \param spk Input format for the filter
    \return Returns true on success and false otherwise.

    Open the filter with the input format provided and allocate resources.

    It is not nessesary to call close() on already open filter because open()
    may reuse previously allocated resources.

    After a successful call to open() get_input() must return the format
    passed to open(), and do this all the time until close() call.

    get_output() must return either:
    - Correct format for the next output chunk.
    - FORMAT_UNKNOWN when filer requires to receive some data to decide its
      output format.

  \fn void Filter::close()
    Close the filter and deallocate resources.

    The use of close() is totally optional. Moreover, use of close() before
    open() is not recommended because open() may reuse previously allocated
    resources.

    The main reason for close() is an explicit resource deallocation.

    This function should not throw.

  \fn bool Filter::is_open() const
    \return Return true when filter is open and can process data.

    This function should not throw.

  \name Processing

  \fn void Filter::reset()
    Reset the filter state, clean all internal buffers and prepare to a new
    stream. Do not deallocate resources, because we're awaiting new data.
    This call should be equivalent to filter.open(filter.get_input()), but we
    do not need to allocate resources once again, just set the internal state
    to initial values.

    In data-driven output format mode filter may change output format to
    FORMAT_UNKNOWN.

    Otherwise, output format must remain unchanged.

    This function should not throw.

  \fn bool Filter::process(Chunk &in, Chunk &out)
    \param in Input data
    \param out Output data
    \retval true  Output chunk contains data.
    \retval false Filter needs more input data. Output data is undefined.

    Process input data and make one output chunk.

    Filter may process only part of the data. In this case it may change input
    chunk's pointers to track the progress. So you may need several process()
    calls with the same input chunk (filter may make several output chunks for
    one input chunk when it is too big).

    Filer may change the input chunk in following ways:
    - Drop timestamp. In most cases filter must do this to prevent processing
      of the same timestamp several times, when process() is called several
      times for the same input chunk.
    - Move rawdata/samples pointers and update size respecively.
    - Completely clear the chunk to indicate that all data was processed.

    Sometimes it is required to determine the amount if input data processed.
    Recommended method follows:

    \code
    uint8_t old_rawdata = chunk.rawdata;
    size_t old_size = chunk.size;
    if (filter->process(chunk, output))
    {
      size_t gone = chunk.size? chunk.rawdata - old_rawdata: old_size;
      ...
    }
    \endcode

    Filter may have its own buffer. In this case output chunk points to this
    buffer. When the buffer is not big enough to process the whole input chunk
    at once filter may return several output chunks.

    Filter may process data inplace, i.e. change data at the input buffer and
    return pointers to the input buffer. In some cases you should be warned
    abount this fact. For example imagine that you have 2 filters in the chain
    and the first filter returns its own buffer, and the second is inplace
    filter. You call process() on the first and feed inplace filter with the
    output. After this, process() call on the first filter will corrupt data
    at the output of the second filter.

    When filter finds an error and cannot proceed, it must throw Filter::Error
    exception. reset() must be called on the filter after an error occurs.

  \fn bool Filter::flush(Chunk &out)
    \param  out   Output data
    \retval true  Output chunk contains data.
    \retval false Filter is flushed. Output data is undefined.

    Flush buffered data. 

    When filter does not require flushing it should just return false.

    Note, that filter may produce several chunks when flushing, so several
    flush() calls may be required.

    In data-driven output format mode filter may change output format to
    FORMAT_UNKNOWN after flushing complete.

    When filter finds an error and cannot proceed, it must throw Filter::Error
    exception. reset() must be called on the filter after an error occurs.

  \fn bool Filter::new_stream() const
    Filter returns a new stream. It may do this for the following reasons:
    - It want the downstream to flush and prepare to receive a new stream.
    - It wants to change the output format

    Both process() and flush() calls may affect this flag

    This flag should appear only for the first chunk in the stream. An example:

    \verbatim
    call            result  new_stream()  get_output()  comment
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    open(spk)       true    false         out_spk       We know the output format immediately
    process(chunk1) true    false         out_spk       1st chunk of format out_spk
    process(chunk1) false   false         out_spk       Need more data
    process(chunk2) true    false         out_spk       2nd chunk of format out_spk
    process(chunk2) true    true          new_out_spk   Format changed, 1st chunk of the new format new_out_spk
    process(chunk2) true    false         new_out_spk   New stream continues, 2nd chunk of format new_out_spk

    call            result  new_stream()  get_output()  comment
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    open(spk)       true    false         spk_unknown   Output format is initially unknown
    process(chunk1) false   false         spk_unknown   Buffering, need more data
    process(chunk2) true    true          out_spk       Ouput format is determined, 1st chunk of format out_spk
    process(chunk2) true    false         out_spk       Stream continues, 2nd chunk of format out_spk
    format change                                       An event that forces the filter to change its output format
    process(chunk2) true    false         out_spk       Flushing started
    process(chunk2) false   false         spk_unknown   Flushing is done, buffering starts,
                                                        filter needs more data to determine a new output format
    process(chunk3) false   false         spk_unknown   Need more data
    process(chunk4) true    true          new_out_spk   New stream starts
    
    \endverbatim

  \name Filter state

  \fn Speakers Filter::get_input() const
    Returns input format of the filter. It must be the same format as passed
    to open() call. This function should be used only when the filter is open,
    otherwise the result is undefined.

  \fn Speakers Filter::get_output() const
    Returns output format of the filter.

    Generally, output format is known immediately after open() call, so you can
    rely on this and init the next filter in the filter chain. But in some
    cases filter cannot determine the format after open() and have to receive
    some data to say what the output format is. In this case output format must
    be set to FORMAT_UNKNOWN after open(), and to the real format on the first
    output chunk.

    Output format may change to FORMAT_UNKNOWN:
    - After flushing (see flush())
    - When filter changes its output format (see new_stream())
    - After reset() call

    Most filters do not change output format during the processing, but some
    can. To change output format filter must explicitly indicate this with
    help of new_stream().

  \name Filter info

  \fn std::string Filter::name() const
    Returns the name of the filter (class name by default).

  \fn std::string Filter::info() const
    Print the filter configuration. Only static parameters should be printed,
    i.e. at the DRC filter we should print the drc factor, but not the current
    gain (that is constantly changing).

  \brief Default implementation for the most of the Filter interface.

  Following functions left unimplemented: can_open() and process().

  If filter requires an initialization, it should override init()/uninit()
  placeholders, instead of open()/close().

  Destructor of the filter must deallocate the resources allocated by init() if
  nessesary. Generally, it may be done by calling uninit().

  \name Open & close the filter

  \fn bool SimpleFilter::open(Speakers new_spk)
    \param new_spk Input format

    Open the filter with the new format.

    Calls init().

    After this call:
    - get_input() and get_output() return new_spk.
    - is_open() returns true

  \fn void SimpleFilter::close()
    Closes the filter.

    Calls uninit().

    After this call:
    - get_input() and get_output() return spk_unknown.
    - is_open() returns false.

  \fn bool SimpleFilter::is_open() const
    Returns true when filter is open and false otherwise.

  \name Initialization

  \fn bool SimpleFilter::init()
    Override this to do some initialization.

    spk member is specifies the current input format.

  \fn void SimpleFilter::uninit()
    Override this to free resources allocated by init().

  \name Processing

  \fn void SimpleFilter::reset()
    Default implementation does nothing.

  \fn bool SimpleFilter::flush(Chunk &out)
    Default implementation does nothing (returns false).

  \fn bool SimpleFilter::new_stream() const
    Default implementation returns false (no format changes).

  \name Filter state

  \fn Speakers SimpleFilter::get_input() const
    Default implementation returns the format passed to open() call.

  \fn Speakers SimpleFilter::get_output() const
    Default implementation returns the format passed to open() call.

    - Speakers::mask != 0
    - Speakers::sample_rate != 0

  \class FilterWrapper
  \brief Wrapper that delegated the interface to another filter.

  Useful to make 'customized' filters that are special cases for more general
  filters. For example, Equalizer class is a specialization for Convolver.

  If no delegate was set, wrapper just does not work (you cannot open the
  filter).

  Filter name is not delegated. So the default behaviour is preserved, and
  you will get wrapper's class name, not the delegate's name.

  \fn void FilterWrapper::wrap(Filter *)
    Set the filter to delegate the interface to.

  \fn void FilterWrapper::unwrap()
    Forget the delegatee filter.
